# This is my first React Project

- The Mcqs on this site are scraped from [Sanfoundry](https://sanfoundary.com) using my scraper.

- The scraped json(s) are stored in saved folder as realtime data retrieval makes api real slow.

  - I have built an api to serve mcqs from all the stored json (it's hosted on heroku)

> Decreased mcq count on display to 150 for performance improvement
> Although if you'll search for mcqs you'll find it
