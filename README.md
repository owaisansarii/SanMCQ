# This is my first React Project

*The Mcqs on this site are scraped from [Sanfoundry](https://sanfoundary.com) using my scraper.
*The scraped json(s) are stored in saved folder as realtime data retrieval makes api real slow.
..*I have built an api to serve mcqs from all the stored json (it's hosted on heroku)
